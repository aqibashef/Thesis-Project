Academic Research Project - SUST


After you clone it in your pc you will get following : 

<ul>
<li>ThesisProject</li>
<li>opencv</li>
</ul>

Now you have to do the following to configure the project to run:

<ol>
<li>Create a new Environment Variable named : "OPENCV_DIR" and add the location of opencv folder to it.</li>
<li>Edit the "Path" or "PATH" variable in Environment Variable and add "%OPENCV_DIR%\x86\vc12\bin". Then save it. </li>
<li>Restart your PC. </li>
</ol>

Now you should be able to run the project, if other system configurations are OK.
